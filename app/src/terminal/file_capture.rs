//! Capturing block and session output to local files.
//!
//! Backs the `Save …/Stream … to file...` context-menu commands that replaced
//! the cloud-only "Share block..." / "Share session..." items.
//!
//! Snapshot commands write once and close. Streaming commands write the same
//! content and then keep the handle open, appending as the command produces
//! more output.
//!
//! ## Why streaming polls
//!
//! There is no "rendered text was appended" event anywhere in the terminal. The
//! only live signal is the raw PTY byte broadcast, which carries escape
//! sequences rather than rendered text, so a stream that wants plain text has to
//! re-render and diff. [`FileStream::update_tail`] is driven from the existing
//! terminal wakeup tick.
//!
//! ## Why the tail can rewrite rather than append
//!
//! A block's grid is not append-only: `\r`, progress bars and cursor movement
//! rewrite lines in place. When a fresh render is still an extension of what was
//! written, only the new suffix is appended. When it is not, the tailed block's
//! section of the file is rewound and rewritten. The file therefore always
//! equals the current rendered output instead of accumulating every intermediate
//! frame of a progress bar.
